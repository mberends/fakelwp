=head1 NAME
fakeLWP - a Perl 6 subset of LWP (Library for Web in Perl)

=head1 DESCRIPTION
Perl 5 LWP is very helpful when writing Web client and even some Web
server software. This is a Perl 6 equivalent.

The right way to build LWP uses socket functions such as connect().
The Rakudo implementation currently (2009-03-04) lacks these functions
and needs a major I/O overhaul before making the right way possible.

At present the only solution is to enlist external utilities such as
wget and netcat to perform the I/O, calling them via run().

Initially this project will consist of fakeLWP::Simple for a quick win.

No. Others do too much of that already. This code is to scratch the itch
-Ofun and to hopefully be obsoleted ASAP.
